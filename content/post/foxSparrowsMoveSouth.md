Late each fall, and then again early in spring, Fox Sparrows visit my backyard. A large, brightly colored - by sparrow standards - bird, they are a harbinger of the changing seasons and a delight to watch during their brief stay. Sometimes they even sing during their brief spring stop-over, a beautiful set of downward, slurred whistles.

Several summers ago, in mid-June, I was wandering through the extensive commercial forestland of western Maine with a pair of foresters, talking about habitat management and how they might incorporate the needs of birds into their forest-management practices. Neither was a birder but, like most foresters, both were keen naturalists and as we walked they frequently stopped to ask me about the birds we were hearing all around us. As the day wore on, I was feeling quite proud of myself as I rattled off identification after identification - a Canada Warbler singing from that thicket and there, off in the distance, a Blackpoll Warbler.

But, as the old proverb says, pride goeth before destruction. We had stopped in an old clearcut that was growing back into a wet mix of young red spruce and balsam fir. All around, the usual suspects were singing away: Magnolia Warbler, Swainson's Thrush, and a noisy group of Canada Jays. Then came a song, clear and loud, from the thick growth of spruce and fir. One of my companions stopped in the middle of a sentence and turned to me with the obvious question: what was that?

Here it is, I thought, the moment when my hard-earned reputation as a serious ornithologist vanishes for good. I looked at my feet and tried to give the appearance that my reluctance to answer was a dramatic flair, when in fact I had absolutely no idea what species we were hearing. I ran through the list of every bird that I knew lived in these young forest of spruce and fir, and I came up with nothing. I was about to admit my ignorance when suddenly it struck me that I knew that song. I'd heard it years ago on a clear spring morning in early April outside of my house in Vermont. It was a song I'd not heard before, so I'd dashed inside, grabbed my binoculars, and tracked down the bird: a Fox Sparrow, en route to its breeding ground, singing away from atop a still-leafless sugar maple.

Fast forward seven years to that clearcut in Maine, and I blurted out the answer. Fox Sparrow! That is the song of a Fox Sparrow. In the interest of proving myself right, we waited a minute until the bird emerged from the foliage and there it was, a bright red sparrow streaked with gray. My forester friends were somewhat less excited that I was - just another sparrow, after all - and so the conversation quickly returned to partial harvests and pre-commercial thinning. But for the rest of the afternoon, I puzzled over that Fox Sparrow. Why was a Fox Sparrow in Maine, singing, in the middle of the breeding season? All of my field guides, and everything that I knew of the bird, told me that they nested in the boreal forest of Canada, hundreds of kilometers north. When I returned to camp that evening, I pulled off the shelf a copy of Ralph Palmer's Maine Birds, now almost 80 years old but still the definitive reference on the birdlife of Maine. As expected, Palmer describes Fox Sparrow as a "transient", a passage migrant that moves through the state early in spring and again late in the fall but most certainly not a breeding species. So what was this bird doing?

I let the issue simmer over the winter. The next spring, I returned to the area to start a project investigating how forest management influenced nesting birds. As part of this work, I spent several weeks surveying bird populations in young stands of spruce and fir regenerating after clearcuts - areas much like that where we'd encountered the singing Fox Sparrow. To my surprise, I found Fox Sparrows singing in almost every stand of thick, young spruce and fir that I visited.

At this point I knew that it wasn't just a wayward bird or two: Fox Sparrows were nesting in big numbers throughout the forests of western Maine. So why do the field guides and general reference books about bird distributions talk about Fox Sparrow as a denizen of the high mountains of the west and the northern boreal forest of Canada and Alaska?

My confusion about the nature of this bird led to a two-year long effort to piece together its current breeding range, which I've written about in a paper submitted for publication at the scientific journal PeerJ. The story goes something like this:

Beginning in the early 1980s, birders in southern Quebec - well south of the known range of the species - began noticing Fox Sparrows during the summer. A few years later, scientists working on a study of how efforts to control spruce-budworm outbreaks in Maine affected bird populations found a Fox Sparrow that they suspected was nesting. In 1983, a Fox Sparrow nest was finally discovered in far northwestern Maine, a stone's throw from the Canadian border.

After that, the floodgates seem to have opened. Fox Sparrows were reported nearly every summer in increasingly far-flung locales, first in the mountains of western Maine, then near Mount Katahdin, and finally, by the mid-1990's in northern New Hampshire. In 1996, a birder discovered the first nest of a Fox Sparrow in New Hampshire, near the northern town of Pittsburg. From there, they appear to have moved south, and are now a regular summertime resident throughout the White Mountains. A few have even showed up on Mountain Birdwatch surveys conducted in the Green Mountains of Vermont and at least one individual has been seen and heard singing on Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondacks of New York. It seems that Fox Sparrows are showing up wherever there are young, dense forests of spruce and fir, whether the stunted krummholz forest of the our mountaintops or the old clearcuts that scatter the commercial forestlands of northern New Hampshire and western Maine.

A species never known to nest in New England prior to the 1980s, Fox Sparrows have expanded their breeding range south by about 400 km in a span of less than 30 years, and seem to be on track to continue this remarkable journey; if past trends are any indicator of the future, they will likely become at least occasional nesters in suitable habitat in Vermont and New York (and indeed, may already be). Although I haven't conducted an exhaustive search of the ornithological literature, I can think of few other bird species that have shifted their range so dramatically in such a short period of time, and none that have done so by moving north to south!  

What explains this phenomenon? Right now, the answer is anyone's guess. One possibility, though, is that we've inadvertently created a lot of suitable habitat for Fox Sparrows through our logging activities. The Fox Sparrow vanguard arrived in Maine at about the same time that large areas of the state's forests were being clearcut in response to the great spruce-budworm epidemic of the time. Doghair stands of spruce and fir sprung up in many of them. As a bird that loves thick stands of young evergreens, this may have offered a wealth of new nesting habitat that allowed new populations to become established and grow.

We've grown used to stories of climate change causing rapid shifts in the distribution of plants and animals across the globe, with southern species marching northward as the climate warms. Very rarely, though, do we see the opposite: a boreal species charging southward.

Much remains to be learned about our new breeding resident: what is driving the southward expansion, what implications exist for the species that make up the biological communities colonized by Fox Sparrows, and where Fox Sparrows will finally stop. In the meantime, though, keep an eye out as you explore the wilds of the northeast and don't be surprised to see one of these boisterous northerners next summer.
