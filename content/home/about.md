# Biography

I am an independent scientist, writer, editor, and explorer of the natural world. My research interests are broad, ranging from natural history to sustainable development. I am a freelance editor at [PLOS Biology](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/).

Most of my writing is scholarly. Sometimes I write about more interesting things, though. When I do, I post it here.
