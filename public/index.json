Using three scales of resolution, we examine the importance of a long-lived desert tree, ironwood (*Olneya tesota*), in structuring plant communities and promoting biological diversity in the Sonoran Desert. We examined the positive effects of *Olneya* canopies of different sizes on plant communities in mesic and xeric habitats throughout the central Gulf Coast subregion of Sonora, Mexico. In xeric sites, *Olneya* canopies had strong positive effects on plant richness and abundance, and small positive effects on the size of plants, underscoring the role of facilitation in extreme environments. In mesic sites, *Olneya* canopies had very little effect on perennials and a negative effect on ephemeral richness, suggesting predominantly competitive effects in this less stressful environment. Overall, *Olneya* canopies increased biological diversity where abiotic stress was high, but did not increase diversity in more mesic areas. Thus *Olneya* canopies caused consistent shifts in plant-community structure among xeric and mesic sites, but not when these landscapes were combined. Benefactor size also mediated positive interactions, with larger *Olneya* canopies supporting larger perennials in both xeric and mesic sites. Thus stress gradients and benefactor size both influenced the balance of facilitative and competitive effects under nurse-plant canopies, and the spatial scale at which facilitative effects shape community structure.","tags":["Facilitation","Community ecology","Desert ecology"],"title":"Positive interactions under nurse-plants: spatial scale, stress gradients and benefactor size","type":"publication"}]
