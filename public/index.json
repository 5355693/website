Obigatory family viewings of “important” movies always feels stilted to me, like making a passenger in your car listen to your favorite song and insisting that they pay close attention to the lyrics.\nClimate change has been much on my mind this week. Not just because we are enduring yet another early-season heat wave here in the northeastern US, but also because I’m attending the Mind and Life Institute’s Summer Research Institute, which this year has the theme of “The Mind, the Human-Earth Connection, and the Climate Crisis”. The time spent with other scholars and activists has encouraged me to think about climate change in ways that I usually do not. I’ve been so focused on the ecological consequences of climate change - and our efforts to mitigate it - that I rarely pause to consider the emotional consequences. For me, for my family, my friends, my community, and for people I don’t and won’t ever know.\nIt was with this in mind that I cued up the documentary Breaking Boundaries: The Science of Our Planet and served dinner on the coffee table in front of the TV. An unusual twist on the classic parental quid pro quo: no dinner until you watch this movie with me.\nWe were about 20 minutes into the movie when I looked over at my son and saw him pick up his phone, type something, and put it back down. Another minute passes and he does it again. And then again. At this point I am convinced with all the righteous fervor of the uninformed that he is snapping with his friends and ignoring this Very Important Film. I am about to offer up some threat to cut off phone privileges when I see that he isn’t on SnapChat but instead has his calculator open and is trying to convert meters - as in meters of sea level rise, which is being discussed on screen - into feet, a unit that is intuitive for him.\nIt was then that I realized he was paying far closer attention then I was (I’m a scientist, right? I know all about planetary boundaries). He was doing his calculations, translating what he heard, and thinking about all of the places in the world that would disappear beneath the waves during his lifetime.\nFor the first time, in that moment, I understood on an emotional level my obligation to him, to his generation, and to all those that will follow him. Climate change is not an abstract for them. It is not something that they will simply complain about (see: “enduring another early-season heat wave”, above), something that will be inconvenient but ultimately manageable.\nWe - those of us born after the 1960s - inherited a dirty, messy planet, too. But our parents did their best to correct the errors of their ways and the ways of their parents. In the United States, they addressed the point-source pollution that rendered most waterways unfit for life, they passed legislation protecting endangered plants and animals, and they made fitful but ultimately successful efforts to reduce air pollution. They missed the boat - and continue to miss the boat - on climate change, but at least in the early years we can offer up ignorance as an excuse.\nThose of us now of an age to vote, to hold elected office, to manage private companies, and to dictate patterns of consumption and production do not have ignorance as an excuse. The science is clear and unambiguous on nearly every salient facet of climate change. We have identified solutions. What many of us seem to lack is the will to take action. And I understand this: even as scientist involved in climate-change research, the ongoing crisis can seem far off and less important than the myriad other immediate problems in our lives.\nYet, in reality, it is not all far off or distant for anyone alive today. We can see the storm clouds and feel the first drops of rain. My responsibility now is to fix firmly in my mind a vision of what the eventual deluge could look like and what it will leave behind for my children. From that vision, to feel their suffering and, if I am sufficently empathetic, to feel the suffering of everything and everyone that will inhabit that same future world. To decide then whether I can muster the compassion to act and the wisdom to understand how to act.\n1 Greenland ice sheet. 6 meters of sea-level rise. 19.7 feet of sea-level rise. 840 million people displaced. 1 chance to make this right.\n","date":1623110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623110400,"objectID":"e30c816133b6fe0aa3a0359d4fe98330","permalink":"https://johnlloyd.name/2021/06/08/climate-obligations/","publishdate":"2021-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2021/06/08/climate-obligations/","section":"post","summary":"Last night I did something that I rarely do: I coerced my son into watching a documentary film with me.

Sometimes it takes the form of a catalog of observations of plants and animals, other times it presents accounts of exploration and adventure in the wild, and sometimes it is as much about the people as the landscape that shapes them.\nNonetheless, perhaps because its subjects and themes appear so constant, it has to me a timeless feel. For better or worse, the style of the narrative tends towards the uniform, even as the subjects and themes differ widely.\nWhat sets apart Donald Culross Peattie’s An Almanac for Moderns, first published in 1935, and what makes it such a unique contribution to this canon, is its blend of modern and classical styles.\nThe tone is modernist, reflecting Peattie’s deep literary background. Even though he was a Harvard-trained scientist, for some years a botanist by trade, he was also a novelist, a columnist for several newspapers, and a poet. He was as connected to the world of letters – his mother a literary critic, father a journalist, and wife, Louise Redfield, an author – as he was to the world of science.\nHe did not wander into the wilderness for exploration or adventure, like young Aldo Leopold or Adolph Murie, but did much of his earlier writing from the prairie of Illinois (now a Chicago suburb) where he lived, worked, and raised his family. But instead of leading to the mundane, these ties to family, to work, and to a society on the verge of yet another global war lend his writing a feel at the same time more cosmopolitan than most natural history and more closely attuned to the common realities of life.\nIn An Almanac for Moderns, Peattie writes with great detail about the lives of everything from slime molds to birds, often using the specifics of his observations as a springboard for discussing larger concepts in ecology and evolution. For example, in early October, he writes of his walks in the wet, autumn woods and of the sudden emergence of fungi of all sorts. This leads to a cataloging of the forms that he finds and finally to a discussion of the roles of decomposers and parasites. Ants, bees, and plants feature prominently in many of Peattie’s musing on natural history, presumably reflecting his background as a botanist and as a student of William Morton Wheeler, the great Harvard myrmecologist.\nAn Almanac for Moderns ranges widely, and extends into themes well beyond natural history. Peattie’s detours from the natural world showcase his novelist’s skill at self-expression and make for engrossing reading, for example where he tells in several beautiful passages of his young child’s battle with scarlet fever.\nTo my eye, these are some of the best writings in the book, even if the natural world is more a symbol of restless fear than a subject of observation: “The singing of the cicadas began at dawn today and continued until sundown. It seemed to frighten the little boy so sick, so terrifyingly sick in bed; he talked of them through his fever in a confused way, and to the two of us, beside the bed, the cry of ‘Pharaoh’ rang out with a wail of fatality.”\nAnd the next day, June eleventh:\n“The cicadas have ceased their singing with sundown, though tonight they woke up, once, like a renewal of my terrors, and wailed that their power was not yet broken. But even in the night silence the terrible sound of ten thousand knives shearing across ten thousand grindstones still rings in my head. I feel as though I would hear it forever, and forever remember when I stood by the window, waiting to hear what the thermometer would tell, certain that all joy is an elf gift and hope a treachery.”\nPeattie’s interest in classical elements is most apparent in the organization of the essays. An Almanac for Moderns is arranged as series of short essays, one for each day of the year, split into sections corresponding to the astrological calendar. The daily writings tend to follow the changing seasons, but the phenology is interwoven with diversions into the lives of notable scientists and, perhaps on days when he found little outside to interest him, frank discourses on philosophy and the place of humankind in the world.\nThe scientists celebrated by Peattie range from the obvious – Burroughs, Muir, Audubon – to the obscure. The lesser-known are more interesting in many ways, and Peattie’s descriptions of their lives have encouraged me to read more broadly. Thanks to Peattie, we meet characters like Sir John Lubbock, who, in addition to being a baron, a banker, and a member of Parliament, also turns out to have made significant contributions to archaeology and the study of Hymenoptera.\nPeattie’s celebrations of the lives of scientists also include real drama. It is hard, for example, not to feel pity for Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, an erratically – and prolifically – creative polymath. He coined over 6,000 specific epithets in the North American flora (many of which have been subsequently ignored), investigated the systematics of fish and molluscs of the Ohio River, and wrote two volumes on the medical uses of plants of the United States. During his lifetime, his peers pilloried him in correspondence as an unprincipled, and perhaps unhinged, charlatan interested only in self-promotion, and he was publically played the fool by a bullying Audubon, who fed him lies and laughed as Rafinesque repeated them as truth. Rafinesque died alone and penniless, his body discovered by a landlord who then attempted to sell the corpse to recoup a debt. As if that were not indignity enough for one lifetime, he was denounced posthumously by Asa Gray as a delusional liar.\nPeattie finds humor in his subjects, too. He recounts the tale of Alexander Wilson, “the first great ornithologist of America,” who was set upon by a captive Ivory-billed Woodpecker, ostensibly the subject of a painting. The erstwhile captive “violently attacked Wilson about the face,” forcing a hasty retreat from the North Carolina hotel room where the young Wilson was working. Wilson returned later to find the room in shambles, and the bird nearly done with a hole excavated through the entirety of one wall.\nThe digressions into philosophy reflect a worldview that seems shaped equally by both a love of the natural world and a fear – no doubt born of the lingering disillusionment with humanity following the First World War – of what humans are capable of doing unto themselves and the world around them. Peattie argues throughout the book for a philosophy based on the supremacy of biological laws; “[t]here is no philosophy with a shadow of realism about it, save a philosophy based upon Nature.” We cannot understand ourselves, says Peattie, without recognizing our place in the natural world.\nAnd because of his conviction that we are part and parcel of the natural world, Peattie is vehement in his condemnation of our trespasses against it. Indeed, he is at his most lyrical as he concludes a cataloging of the ways in which we waste the bounty that surrounds us: “And in the end [man] may present the spectacle of some Brobdingnagian spoiled baby, gulping down his cake and howling for it too.”\nSome days Peattie has little to say, which I find humanizing; I would find less common ground with someone capable of uninterrupted inspiration. An Almanac for Moderns is not the kind of prose that keeps one reading into the small hours, but it always pulls me in for longer than I plan. Despite several efforts to do so, I have never been able to read An Almanac for Moderns as some have suggested it should be: day-by-day, following the course of the year. I pick it up, and put it down, but I am always drawn to read just one more essay.\nThis is not a book that will provide much new insight into the natural history of the Midwestern United States, and indeed many of Peattie’s musings on evolution and life history are dated or simply wrong: monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) do migrate, Ivory-billed Woodpeckers (Campephilus principalis) did not inhabit the forests of Brazil, and fireflies (Coleoptera:Lampyridae) do not glow because of internal, luminous bacteria. Modern readers will find Peattie’s views on race, and to a lesser extent gender, regressive, but these digressions are mercifully brief and hardly malicious.\nDespite these failings, it is a lyrical and wide-ranging and thoughtfully crafted book about the natural world and our place in it, and for me it has served as a reminder of the romance of natural history and the value of being aware of the lives lived all around us. Natural history is not a practice only for the mountaintop or remote rainforest; we may, as Peattie believed, learn as much observing the ants amidst the cracks of the sidewalk.\nLike most of us, he yearned for the sublime at times – “I would go now, if I could, to the mountains…some gentle hills, mere unevenness in the land, will not help me” – but never scorned or overlooked the commonplace. It is an inspiring and reassuring book, especially for those of us lacking the Skutchian patience needed to stare unblinking at a bird’s nest for days on end, or whose careers and lives will not be spent describing new species or traveling unmapped wilderness. No matter where we are, or what we do, we can remember always that “Life, brother, is not all mankind…[w]ait with me a little; only listen to the soft, tremendous footfalls of a destiny that is greater than ours; hear a while the hum of summer, for it is not only the scraping of the small chitinous instruments of insects; it is the singing of the world’s blood as it runs in your own veins and sounds in your own ears.”\nThis post originally appeared in the Journal of Natural History Education \u0026amp; Experience.\n","date":1621987200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621987200,"objectID":"8b3c2fc7c5a8891c674e1b20b5110dc5","permalink":"https://johnlloyd.name/2021/05/26/almanac-for-mods/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2021/05/26/almanac-for-mods/","section":"post","summary":"Natural-history writing comes in many flavors.

Large and brightly colored, at least by sparrow standards, they are a harbinger of the changing seasons and a delight to watch during their brief stay. Sometimes they even sing during their brief spring stop-over, a beautiful set of downward, slurred whistles.\nMost field guides and general references depict Fox Sparrows as a bird that nests only in the boreal forest of Canada and Alaska and the high mountains of western North America. The eastern subspecies of Fox Sparrow—the Red Fox Sparrow (Passerella iliaca iliaca)—has traditionally been considered a passage migrant through New England, stopping off briefly in late fall and early spring as it travels to and from its breeding grounds in eastern Canada. However, several summers ago, while working in western Maine, I encountered several singing males in mid-June. As this seemed quite late for birds supposedly migrating through the region, I was intrigued. When I returned to camp that evening, I pulled off the shelf a copy of Ralph Palmer’s Maine Birds, now almost 80 years old but still the definitive reference on the birdlife of Maine. As expected, Palmer describes Fox Sparrow as a “transient,” a passage migrant that moves through the state early in spring and again late in the fall but most certainly not a breeding species. So what were these birds that I’d found singing in the middle of June doing? Why was a species that supposedly only migrates through the region present during the breeding season and apparently defending territories?\nThese questions led to a two-year long effort to piece together its current breeding range, which I’ve written about in a paper submitted for publication at the scientific journal PeerJ. The story goes something like this:\nBeginning in the early 1980s, birders in southern Quebec—well south of the known range of the species—began noticing Fox Sparrows during the summer. A few years later, scientists working on a study of how efforts to control spruce-budworm outbreaks in Maine affected bird populations found a Fox Sparrow that they suspected was nesting. In 1983, a Fox Sparrow nest was finally discovered in far northwestern Maine, a stone’s throw from the Canadian border.\nAfter that, the floodgates seem to have opened. Fox Sparrows were reported nearly every summer in increasingly far-flung locales, first in the mountains of western Maine, then near Mount Katahdin, and finally, by the mid-1990’s in northern New Hampshire. In 1996, a birder discovered the first Fox Sparrow nest in New Hampshire, near the northern town of Pittsburg. From there, they appear to have moved south, and are now a regular summertime resident throughout the White Mountains. A few have even showed up on Mountain Birdwatch surveys conducted in the Green Mountains of Vermont and at least one individual has been seen and heard singing on Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondacks of New York. Based on an analysis of checklists submitted to eBird, it seems that Fox Sparrows are showing up wherever there are young, dense forests of spruce and fir, whether it be the stunted krummholz forest of our mountaintops or the old clearcuts of commercial forestlands scattered throughout northern New Hampshire and western Maine.\nA species never known to nest in New England prior to the 1980s, Fox Sparrows have expanded their breeding range south by about 400 km in a span of less than 30 years, and seem to be on track to continue this remarkable journey. If past trends are any indicator of the future, they will likely become at least occasional nesters in suitable habitat in Vermont and New York (and indeed, may already be). Although I haven’t conducted an exhaustive search of the ornithological literature, I can think of few other bird species that have shifted their range so dramatically in such a short period of time, and none that have done so by moving north to south!\nThe breeding range of Fox Sparrow (Passerella iliaca iliaca) has expanded southward out of Canada’s boreal forest by several hundred miles since the early 1980s. Colored dots on the map show the location and year of eBird checklists that contain an observation of Fox Sparrow.\n What explains this phenomenon? Right now, the answer is anyone’s guess. One possibility, though, is that we’ve inadvertently created a lot of suitable habitat for Fox Sparrows through our logging activities. The Fox Sparrow vanguard arrived in Maine at about the same time that large areas of the state’s forests were being clearcut in response to the great spruce-budworm epidemic of the time. Dog-hair stands of spruce and fir sprung up in many of them. As a bird that loves thick stands of young evergreens, this may have offered a wealth of new nesting habitat that allowed new populations to become established and grow.\nWe’ve grown used to stories of climate change causing rapid shifts in the distribution of plants and animals across the globe, with southern species marching northward as the climate warms. Very rarely, though, do we see the opposite: a boreal species charging southward.\nMuch remains to be learned about our new breeding resident: what is driving the southward expansion, what implications exist for the species that make up the biological communities colonized by Fox Sparrows, and where Fox Sparrows will finally stop. In the meantime, though, keep an eye out as you explore the wilds of the northeast and don’t be surprised to see one of these boisterous northerners next summer.\n","date":1621987200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621987200,"objectID":"5edf419d160b629a72f536649e49e78c","permalink":"https://johnlloyd.name/2021/05/26/fox-sparrows-move-south/","publishdate":"2021-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2021/05/26/fox-sparrows-move-south/","section":"post","summary":"Late each fall, and then again early in spring, Fox Sparrows visit my backyard.

My wet, salty pants chafe miserably at the back of my legs. All around me stand red mangroves, aerial roots spreading out like the legs of some enormous spider. Stretched across a low branch just above the water is a mangrove salt marsh snake, warming itself in the morning’s first rays of sun.\n  A lane of open water cuts through a forest of red mangrove in south Florida.   No car horns, no rumble of outboard motors, no sign or sounds of people at all, in fact, just the steady drone of insects and the rattling whinny of a Red-bellied Woodpecker. The contrail of a jet across the thin blue strip of sky above me is the only reminder that I’m here in present-day Florida, deep in a small tributary of the Shark River, along the state’s southwest coast.\nIt isn’t quite 7:00 AM but the late-April heat is already suffocating. No breeze. Rivulets of sweat run down my forehead and into my eyes. I’d rub them, but I’m wearing vinyl gloves and am completely zipped into my bug suit. I briefly consider removing my hood for just a minute to catch a breath of air before returning to my senses: my clothes are covered in hundreds of mosquitos waiting patiently for a gap to emerge in my fabric defenses. Out here, you either live with the discomfort of being covered head-to-toe or you agree to donate substantial amounts of blood to the local mosquito population.\nWelcome to Mangrove Cuckoo country.\nMangrove Cuckoos bring birders both joy and frustration, much like our children, the weather, or the Chicago Cubs. With Mangrove Cuckoos, the joy comes from the encounter, borne out of some special combination of location, timing, and luck. Often you’ll hear one before you see it: that unmistakable series of guttural “aww” notes, rising and falling in volume and pitch.\nIt isn’t an especially melodic song, but it snapped me to attention the first time that I heard it. On high alert, I scanned the vegetation all around me with just a hint of desperation. I didn’t want this bird to disappear before I had a look at it.\nAnd then, there it was: swooping down from a perch with wings flared wide. Nothing spectacular to see, grayish-brown back and wings, long tail trailing behind, bright white terminal spots contrasting on otherwise black outer tail feathers. Alighting for a moment on a low, exposed branch, it turned towards me, the sinking sun briefly illuminating the tawny belly and the bright yellow lower bill set hard against the entirely black upper bill. Not a Yellow-billed Cuckoo, its more common cousin. The white eyebrow highlighting the racoon-like face mask gave it a look of skeptical curiosity. And then, quick as it came, the bird was gone into the dim, shadowy understory, perfectly camouflaged.\n  A peek into the secret life of the elusive Mangrove Cuckoo. Here, two birds engage in a bit of foreplay. The male, grasping the back of his mate, offers a bit of food as an enticement. If she accepts, this courtship feeding is a precursor to mating.   The frustration, of course, comes from the reality that these encounters are rare. Rare even for me after spending the better part of a decade tromping through the wilds – and not-so-wilds – of south Florida, studying the natural history of Mangrove Cuckoos.\nLocation, timing, and luck. As with any of the uncommon birds that we chase, finding a Mangrove Cuckoo is about being in the right place at the right time. And, frankly, about being a little lucky. Science doesn’t help so much with luck, but arming yourself with a bit of natural history can help when it comes to location and timing.\nStart with location. First, some bad news: the geographic range of Mangrove Cuckoo in the mainland United States is tiny, and their preferred habitat is roadless and flooded. Mangrove Cuckoos live only in the narrow strip of mangroves that fringe the coast of southern Florida. Outside of a handful of easily accessible locations, they inhabit some truly wild places.\n  A reminder of why we stick to the tidal creeks: foot travel through the flooded, snarled tangle that is a mangrove forest is impossible.   Mangrove Cuckoos are also non-migratory and exceedingly unlikely to show up as vagrants anywhere north of southern Florida. Texas has recorded 10 observations, and Louisiana and Alabama each have a single accepted record of Mangrove Cuckoo. So, unless you are staggeringly lucky, finding a Mangrove Cuckoo in the mainland United States requires making your way to Florida and then at least as far south as Tampa Bay. Leave the mainland behind, and you can find Mangrove Cuckoos throughout the islands of the Caribbean, along both coasts of Mexico and Central America, and as far south as Brazil.\nOddly enough, only in Florida and Brazil do Mangrove Cuckoos live solely in mangroves. In Mexico, I’ve seen them in dry forests at an elevations of nearly 4,000 feet. In Puerto Rico, they are common in shade-grown coffee plantations. Although they inhabit mangroves wherever they occur, it is only at the northern and southern edges of their range that Mangrove Cuckoos are truly specialists of mangrove forests.\nNow some good news about location.\nWhen I first started studying Mangrove Cuckoos in Florida, and wanted to know more about where and how they live, I figured that the best place to look for them would be the wildest, most pristine mangrove forests that I could find. That led me to spend one spring navigating the backcountry of Everglades National Park in a small kayak.\nI camped on beaches and chickees (the Seminole word for ‘house’, but in this case referring specifically to the above-water camping platforms in the park’s backcountry), came close to learning how many mosquito bites it requires to exsanguinate a human, was bumped on more than one occasion by a curious or hungry bull shark, enjoyed the company of bottlenose dolphins, and discovered a new appreciation for the raw beauty of that flooded landscape. I even found a few Mangrove Cuckoos.\nWhat I later learned is that this was a fun but unnecessarily difficult way to find a Mangrove Cuckoo. Yes, you will find them in the majestic and towering forests along the Shark River – where you might enjoy the scenery and lack of traffic noise, too – but Mangrove Cuckoos aren’t especially choosy about the kind of mangrove forest they inhabit, as long as they have enough space. Given a large enough patch of mangroves – 70 acres is about the minimum size, and most individuals seem to need closer to 300 acres – you can also find them behind strip malls and next to busy highways. Add that as another benefit to conserving Florida’s remaining mangroves, even those that may not seem pristine or especially wild (San Carlos Bay – Bunche Beach Preserve in Fort Myers being an excellent example of this).\nOnce you’ve decided on a good location, whether discovered through your own travels or by visiting one of the well-known hotspots, be patient. Mangrove Cuckoos move around. A lot. One radio-tagged bird that I followed travelled more than 20 miles in one day – not migrating, just moving from place to place.\nThat kind of wandering is almost wolf-like in its expansiveness. Why Mangrove Cuckoos need such large blocks of habitat isn’t clear, but one speculation is that their diet demands it. Even more so than other cuckoos, Mangrove Cuckoos seem to like big prey: frogs, lizards, and large insects. Perhaps finding enough of these choice morsels, especially in mangroves, requires a lot of travel.\nParadoxically, once you find a Mangrove Cuckoo, it will often pose nicely for photographs and will reward your patience with extended opportunities for observation. They travel great distances to find food, but when they are actively hunting they methodically search their immediate surroundings. They walk slowly along branches, pausing frequently for extended periods of time, craning their necks in almost grotesque fashion as they search the undersides of leaves for food.\nA drawback of their patient hunting style is that Mangrove Cuckoos will not attract your attention with flitting and dashing like a warbler or flycatcher. Here’s where timing comes in: it is a lot easier to find these birds during the breeding season, when they are more likely to be heard singing.\nWe don’t know exactly when Mangrove Cuckoos nest in Florida, although it probably begins around the end of the winter dry season, usually in April, and may continue through July or early August.\nOne clue about the breeding status of Mangrove Cuckoos is the color of the bare skin around the eye. Long thought to reflect age (and still noted as such in field guides) – gray in juvenile birds, and yellow in adults – we now know that the color of the eye-ring reflects readiness to breed. Birds begin exhibiting a dusky-gray eye-ring as the breeding season begins. Like an aspen leaf in fall it will turn yellow as the summer ends and will remain so until the following spring.\nFrom late summer until March, Mangrove Cuckoos tend to be quiet and solitary. This, coupled with their generally unobtrusive behavior, overall rarity, and preference for difficult environments, probably explains why many naturalists assumed that Mangrove Cuckoos migrated out of Florida during the winter (the first published observation of a Mangrove Cuckoo in winter in Florida didn’t occur until 1955, on the Coot Bay Christmas Bird Count). We now know that they remain in the state all year, but can become quite hard to find in winter.\nBack to location, timing, and luck. Being in the right habitat at the right time of year will increase your chances of encountering a Mangrove Cuckoo. It’s worth remembering, though, that it is still a game of chance. The quest for a cuckoo rewards the well-prepared and patient, but neither is a guarantee. Keep this in mind: hidden within Florida’s mangrove forests, which cover 1,000 square miles of mostly inaccessible coastline, are no more than about 7,000 Mangrove Cuckoos. To put that number in perspective, there are about 200 million American Robins in the United States.\nAll of these thoughts run through my head as I stand in that flooded forest of mangroves along that unnamed tributary of the Shark River, staring at a green wall of foliage that I keep expecting to open and reveal the prize of a Mangrove Cuckoo. It’s nearly 10 in the morning now, and I’ve been out here for hours. It’s hot enough that the mosquitos have given way to the no-see-ums, which is no improvement at all.\nJust yesterday a Mangrove Cuckoo, probably a male on a territory, perched right here, calling and preening for nearly 20 minutes while I floated along with the tide in my kayak. I’d hoped to include it in my research. Over the weeks to come, I’ll return to this spot again and again, and never see or hear a Mangrove Cuckoo. As I climb back into the kayak to start the journey home, hot and exhausted, I am given a bit of solace in knowing that when I make it back to the boat ramp, the birders that I will meet as I shuttle gear from kayak to truck will understand and sympathize.

In the United States (U.S.), it occurs only in the disturbed montane forests of fir (*Abies balsamea*) and spruce (*Picea* spp.) in the northeastern states of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Climate change is expected to substantially diminish this vegetation community (50% extinction from current range) by 2300. Despite the increasingly tenuous conservation status of the species, fundamental demographic parameters remain unknown and overall population size is uncertain. We used N-mixture models in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to predict population size and to elucidate spatial and temporal patterns of Bicknell’s Thrush abundance in the northeastern United States. From 2011 to 2016, as part of Mountain Birdwatch, citizen-scientists conducted 14,552 five-minute point counts at 747 sampling locations along hiking trails. Observers detected Bicknell’s Thrush at 49.4% of points and tallied 1079 observations of the species. Bicknell’s Thrush abundance was parsimoniously modeled as a complex function of elevation, forest canopy cover, and latitude.

Using dynamic community models analyzed within a Bayesian framework, we found significant changes in detectability, with some species becoming more readily detected after the storms and others becoming more difficult to detect during surveys. Changes in occupancy were equally mixed. Five species – mostly granivores and omnivores, but also Black-whiskered Vireo (*Vireo altiloquus*), a migratory insectivore - occupied more sites in 2018 than in 2015. Twelve species were less common after the hurricanes, including all of the obligate frugivores. Declines in site-occupancy rates were not only more common than increases, but tended to be of greater magnitude. Our results support the general conclusions that bird species respond largely independently to changes in forest structure caused by hurricanes, but that some dietary guilds, notably frugivores, are more sensitive and more likely to show changes in abundance or occupancy following strong storms.","tags":["Hurricanes","Caribbean birds","Puerto Rico"],"title":"Short-term effects of hurricanes Maria and Irma on forest birds of Puerto Rico","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["conservation"],"content":"Last December, a team led by scientist Tatsuya Amano from the University of Oxford’s Conservation Science Group published an important paper on waterbird conservation. Using data collected across the globe, they examined population changes over the past 3 decades in 461 species of waterbird, including everything from ducks to shorebirds to flamingos. During this time, waterbirds in some parts of the world thrived, but in other places they experienced steep declines. When the scientists looked for an explanation for this pattern, they were able to isolate two key predictors of whether waterbird populations shrunk or grew.\nPredictably, the loss of surface water explained some of the decline in waterbird numbers. Central Asia, for example, has lost vast amounts of its surface water due to drought, diversion and damming of rivers, and unregulated water withdrawals for human use; waterbird populations in this part of the world declined steeply. This makes sense: without surface water, these species have no place to live.\nSurprisingly, more important even than the loss of surface water was the role of effective governance. Waterbirds declined significantly in countries with weak or ineffective governments, but their numbers grew in countries that were politically stable and well-governed. The overall effectiveness of a country’s government, quantified annually by the World Bank, includes a variety of factors like regulatory quality, rule of law, control of corruption, and accountability, but the most likely link between waterbird population health and governance is through the environmental aspects of governmental regulation. When countries have well-enforced environmental rules and high levels of investment in conservation, waterbirds – and presumably other wildlife – thrive. For example, Iran, with weak regulation of hunting and limited protections for wetlands, saw substantial declines in waterbirds. During the same time period, waterbirds thrived throughout the countries of the European Union, where protections for birds and their habitats are stringent.\nCoincidentally, two days after this study of waterbird populations was published, the US Department of Interior announced that it would no longer strictly enforce the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, one of our oldest and most important environmental laws, and one of the few that specifically protects birds.\nThe Migratory Bird Treaty Act was originally enacted in 1918 to implement a convention on bird conservation between the US and Great Britain, acting as the sovereign of Canada. The Act was later amended to implement conventions with three other nations that share bird populations with the US: Mexico, Russia, and Japan. Enacted at a time when bird populations faced devastating threats from commercial hunting, the intent of the law was clear: to promote bird conservation by prohibiting the unregulated killing of wild birds. Although clearly motivated by the wanton slaughter of birds taking place at the time, the language of the Act itself is general. Simply put, except as otherwise expressly allowed, it is illegal, “at any time, by any means or in any manner”, to kill any bird that is protected under the Act or to take its nest or eggs.\nThe Trump administration prefers a different interpretation. According to its memorandum, the Department of Interior now views only those actions “that have as their purpose the taking or killing of migratory birds, their nests or their eggs” as violations of the Act. In other words, only actions intended to directly kill birds count as violations of the Act. This upends the interpretation that has been held by every prior administration in recent history – Republican or Democrat – from Richard Nixon to Barack Obama, which was quite simple: the Act prohibits the unregulated killing of birds, whether the intent was to kill them or not.\nThis is not a picayune distinction. Market hunters and milliners are no longer the preeminent threats to bird populations in North America. Outside of the closely regulated and sustainable hunting of game birds, most human-caused bird deaths in the US are inadvertent. Each year we unintentionally kill hundreds of thousands of birds when when they are poisoned by pesticides or in tailing ponds at mines or oil wells, when they collide with wind turbines or communication towers, or when they are caught accidentally in gill nets. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act has been the only tool to address these important but otherwise unregulated sources of mortality, and now even that modest bastion of regulation looks to have fallen by the wayside.\n  A Forster’s Tern accidentally entangled in fishing net. From the article “Hope for Migratory Sea Birds” by Cynthia Henderson Vega, which appeared in the Winter 2000 issue of Coastwatch   The Department of Interior relied in part on judicial uncertainty to justify its reinterpretation of the Act as a prohibition only on illegal hunting and unregulated oology. And indeed, courts have long split on how to interpret the meaning of the statutory language. Some have held that the Act applies to any activity that results in the killing of birds, whereas others have held that the Act only applies when birds were intentionally killed.\nYet the Act has been a successful tool for bird conservation despite this uncertainty. In a remarkable letter, 17 former high-level Department of Interior officials, including political appointees from the Obama, Clinton, and George W. Bush administrations, wrote Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke encouraging him to reconsider this policy. As they put it, the Act “can and has been successfully used to reduce gross negligence by companies that simply do not recognize the value of birds to society or the practical means to minimize harm. Your new interpretation needlessly undermines a history of great progress, undermines the effectiveness of the migratory bird treaties, and diminishes U.S. leadership.”\nUnder previous administrations, the Fish and Wildlife Service, empowered by a commitment to conservation at the highest levels of government, used the Act to signal the seriousness with which they viewed any activity that led to death of birds. Industries whose activities threatened bird populations – oil and gas, fishing, coal, wind and solar power, and electric-transmission utilities, to name a few – understood the rules and, as a result, acted proactively to take measures to minimize the risk that they would, in the course of carrying out otherwise-legal business activities, kill birds.\nWith the Trump administration signaling its lack of interest in holding industries accountable for causing unnecessary bird deaths, little incentive exists for maintaining the common-sense conservation measures that previous interpretations of the Act required. Oil producers working to keep migratory birds away from toxic tailing ponds or wind-power companies that shut turbines down during peak bird-migration times may see no reason to continue these activities. Commercial fishing fleets need no longer worry about solving the problem of seabirds drowning in nets or on baited lines. One of my first jobs out of school involved helping engineering firms to comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act during the construction of bridges and roads, which generally involved things as simple as waiting to tear down an old bridge until Cliff Swallow colonies had fledged their young. Now, even minor acts of conservation like this will be harder to come by.\n  Cliff Swallows nesting beneath a bridge in North Carolina. Photo by Ken Thomas.   Given the scope and breadth of the Act, the significance of the recent change in interpretation by the Trump administration is not easily overstated. The Act currently affords protection for more than 1,000 bird species, including every species native to the US. Indeed, it is the only legal protection for most of them; unless a bird species is otherwise specifically protected by law – for example by the Endangered Species Act or the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act – then regulations promulgated under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act represent their only formal line of defense. This would include almost any bird that you’ve seen in Vermont in the past year: Hermit Thrush or Scarlet Tanager, Tree Swallow or Chimney Swift; none are specifically protected by any Federal law save for the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.\nAs we know from the Tatsuya Amano’s work on waterbirds, and from our country’s own history of successes and failures in bird conservation, weak or inconsistently enforced laws and stingy investments in conservation will eventually lead to the demise of wildlife populations. Unfortunately, we appear well on our way to meeting both of these conditions. Federal and state investment in conservation in the US has declined sharply over the past decade (for example, see here or here) and, with the decision to weaken the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and similar efforts targeting the Endangered Species Act, we are poised to enter an era of in which environmentally damaging activities will no longer face strict regulation.\nThe US Congress enacted the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918 as a response to our collective failure to regulate our own worst behaviors, and in doing so created the conditions that allowed for one of the great conservation success stories of all time. Now, in the form of a 41-page memorandum, we face a failure of governance that may undo many of the gains we have realized in bird conservation. What’s more, we risk these gains for no good reason: the change in policy is a solution in search of a problem. For decades, administrations of all political stripes have found ways to balance the needs of people and of birds within the broad outlines of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Abandoning the principles of conservation enshrined in the Act will benefit few, if any, people, but will surely come at a cost to the birds that we all cherish.\n","date":1583452800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583452800,"objectID":"67fcf1faebf385f9f24ebbd291d18b31","permalink":"https://johnlloyd.name/2020/03/06/losing-protections-for-birds/","publishdate":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2020/03/06/losing-protections-for-birds/","section":"post","summary":"Last December, a team led by scientist Tatsuya Amano from the University of Oxford’s Conservation Science Group published an important paper on waterbird conservation.

A walk through my woods in winter, although lovely in its own right, tends to yield fairly few birds. If I’m lucky, I might come across a noisy flock of Golden-crowned Kinglets, Black-capped Chickadees, and Brown Creepers. Just as easily, though, I can spend an hour wandering through the snow in absolute silence; the trees seem empty of birdlife.\nThe feeders, though, are comparatively busy: in some winters, I’m visited by hundreds of Common Redpolls, although this year so far has been the year of the Dark-eyed Junco. Dozens of them have been daily at my feeders since before the snow fell, and with the storm of last week they’ve taken to perching on the feeders, a behavior I don’t recall seeing so commonly before.\nThen there are the regulars, always present as soon as I fill the feeders in early winter. Chickadees, Tufted Titmice, American Goldfinches, hordes of Blue Jays, a hardy trio of Northern Cardinals, and a rotating cast of Downy Woodpeckers and Hairy Woodpeckers. The last two species pose a real challenge for many birdwatchers. Similar in almost every feature of their plumage, they are most readily distinguishable by their size. Hairy Woodpeckers are about 50% again as big as Downy Woodpeckers, and carry a relatively longer bill.\nDespite their close resemblance of one another, various studies have revealed that these two species are in fact not close relatives of one another. Downy Woodpeckers are probably more closely related to two species of western North America, Nuttall’s Woodpecker and Ladder-backed Woodpecker. Hairy Woodpeckers, by contrast, are a sister to the Arizona Woodpecker and the Mexican endemic Strickland’s Woodpecker. Indeed, to find the closest common ancestor of Hairy and Downy woodpeckers, one must travel all the way back in time to the primordial Picoides woodpecker, the mother of all subsequent species in this genus (I should point out that woodpeckers are no exception to the rule that no taxonomy is ever certain; one recent study argues that Hairy and Downy woodpeckers are neither in the same genus nor belong in Picoides. Nonetheless, the point remains: they aren’t the closest of relatives).\nThat these two species were not especially close relatives came as some surprise to ornithologists. Plumage similarities of the sort exhibited by Downy and Hairy woodpeckers tend to reflect a recent, shared evolutionary history; in the parlance of evolutionary biologists these shared characteristics are homologous, or features inherited from a common ancestor. Humans have forelimbs that are anatomically similar to salamanders, cats, whales, and every other vertebrate because we share a common ancestor, not because each group independently evolved the same set of bones. In other words, we assumed that these woodpeckers looked alike because they were alike.\nIn the case of Downy and Hairy woodpeckers, however, the similarities are not homologous. Each is more closely related to a very different looking group of woodpeckers (cases in point: Hairy Woodpeckers are more closely related to White-headed Woodpeckers and Smoky-brown Woodpeckers than to Downy Woodpeckers), which rules out the possibility that they inherited their matching plumages from a common ancestor. Chances are that the common ancestor of both looked quite different from either. This means that the more likely explanation for being look-alikes is that the resemblance is evolved. For some reason, two different-looking species have come to appear quite the same.\nMimicry is widespread in nature, perhaps the most familiar example being Monarch and Viceroy butterflies. As adults, Monarchs are unpalatable to potential predators because they sequester toxic compounds gained from the milkweed they consume as caterpillars, and the Viceroy was thought to have evolved as a mimic to take advantage of this protection from predation. This has long been held as the iconic example of Batesian mimicry, in which a palatable or poorly defended species comes over evolutionary time to resemble a toxic or otherwise dangerous species. More recently, some evidence suggests that the Viceroy is itself unpalatable, which means that the mimicry is instead Mullerian, wherein two equally dangerous species come to mimic one another’s warning signals, thus reinforcing, for example, the danger of eating any large, orange butterfly. Whereas Batesian mimicry is about tricking predators into thinking you are inedible, Mullerian mimicry is all about consistent messaging to potential predators.\nIt isn’t likely that the similarities between Hairy and Downy woodpeckers have anything to do with this kind of mimicry, however. As far as we know, both would make a perfectly good meal for a hungry Sharp-shinned Hawk. So why have these two species evolved to look nearly the same as one another? The first ornithologists to describe this apparent case of evolved similarity struggled to offer a plausible explanation. Recently, though, Yale University professor of ornithology Richard Prum has proposed an interesting and novel explanation.\nHe argues that Downy Woodpeckers benefit by looking like the larger and more aggressive Hairy Woodpecker because it reduces the chance of an attack by a Hairy Woodpecker. Based on our understanding of avian vision, the size difference between the two species is difficult for a bird to perceive at a distance of more than a few meters. This means that a Hairy Woodpecker approaching a Downy Woodpecker may easily mistake it for another Hairy Woodpecker because the one distinguishing feature – size – is imperceptible at distance. A Hairy Woodpecker could always use its larger size to chase a Downy Woodpecker away from a prime feeding spot or potential nest cavity, but would have no such guarantee should it choose to battle another Hairy Woodpecker. As such, Downy Woodpeckers might occasionally avoid a fight – one they are sure to lose – simply by tricking their larger opponent into misjudging the odds of victory. If the two species compete for feeding and nesting opportunities, as they seem to do, then a win here and there due to this trickery might offer a real evolutionary advantage to mimicry. And mimicry doesn’t have to work every time; it just has to work often enough to give some small advantage to Downy Woodpeckers that more closely resemble Hairy Woodpeckers. Over time, with natural selection acting to reward mimics, Downy Woodpeckers might plausibly evolve to closely resemble their larger cousin.\nPrum has identified nearly 100 other cases of avian mimicry that might have evolved in similar fashion. One of the more spectacular examples is the mimicry of the Eurasian Sparrowhawk by several species of Old World cuckoo. Presumably, a cuckoo that looks like a hawk is less likely to be singled out for attack by another hawk. The cuckoos are such good mimics that they fool not only people (a fine example came during Edgar Chance’s early studies of the common cuckoo in England: one of his study birds was nearly shot and killed by a villager convinced that the bird was a hawk) but even other birds; tits – which are neither eaten nor harassed in any way by cuckoos – respond to cuckoos as though they were a predatory hawk.\nAlthough perhaps less dramatic, Lesser Yellowlegs and Greater Yellowlegs provide another example familiar to birdwatchers in the northeastern United States. These species are not close relatives of one another (Lesser Yellowlegs are closer genetically to Willets than to Greater Yellowlegs), yet, as many of us have discovered with chagrin, they are nearly identical in appearance. Might this similarity of form ease the burden of competition for the smaller of the two species?\nGreater Yellowlegs and Lesser Yellowlegs, side-by-side. Which is which?

However, recent observations suggest that the species is present during the summer months throughout much of the northeastern U.S., unexpected for a species characterized as a passage migrant in the region. To clarify, I conducted a literature review to document the historical status of the species in the northeastern U.S. and then analyzed observations submitted to eBird to describe its recent and current status in the region. Historical accounts consistently identify Fox Sparrow as a passage migrant through the region during early spring and late fall. Beginning in the early 1980s, observers began noting regular extralimital records of Fox Sparrow in northern Maine. A single nest was discovered in the state in 1983, and another in northern New Hampshire in 1997. Despite the paucity of breeding records, observations submitted to eBird suggest that the southern limit of the breeding range of Fox Sparrow has expanded rapidly to the south and west in recent years. The proportion of complete checklists submitted to eBird that contained at least one observation of Fox Sparrow grew at an annual rate of 18% from 2003-2016 and was independent of observer effort. Fox Sparrow now occurs regularly on mountaintops and in young stands of spruce (*Picea* spp.) and balsam fir (*Abies balsamea*) during the breeding season throughout northern and western Maine and northern New Hampshire, with occasional records from the Green Mountains of Vermont and the Adirondack Mountains of New York. The cause of this rapid expansion of its breeding range is unknown, but may be related to an increase in the amount of young conifer forest in the northeastern U.S. created by commercial timber harvest.","tags":["biological diversity","natural history","geographic distribution"],"title":"The recent expansion of Fox Sparrow (Passerella iliaca iliaca)  breeding range into the northeastern United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536465600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://johnlloyd.name/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In June 2016, we assembled a group of scientists, practitioners, and policy-makers who are involved professionally with biodiversity conservation and charged them with the task of co-creating a research agenda for biodiversity conservation in Vermont.

Think of it as the dry land version of the intertidal zone: washed over by temperate waves of life from the south but deeply influenced by the boreal forests to its north. Neither life zone dominates, but instead both contribute elements, and the result is unique. Perhaps due to the chimeric nature of this life zone, or perhaps because it is overshadowed by its parents - two of the great biomes of the planet - we don\u0026rsquo;t have a good name for it. Instead, we call it the \u0026ldquo;spruce-fir forest\u0026rdquo;, with an occasional modifier to indicate whether it happens to be growing on a mountain top or a valley bottom.\nAlthough boreal at first glance, the inland spruce-fir forest of the northeastern United States is in fact very much its own. Wet and cloudy, it rarely burns, a marked contrast with the true boreal forests to the north, whose character is heavily influenced by fire. The spruces that give these forests half of their name are red spruce (Picea rubens), not the white (Picea glauca) or black spruce (Picea mariana) of the boreal forest. Although it provides the southern-most home for icons of the boreal forest of Canada and Alaska like the Canada lynx (Lynx lynx) and Canada jay (Perisoreus canadensis), it is also inhabited by their southern relatives, bobcat (Lynx rufus) and blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata). And unlike the boreal forest, which wreathes the entire Northern Hemisphere, or the hardwood forests which stretched from the edge of the Great Plains to the Atlantic Ocean, the spruce-fir forest exists nowhere as a great stretch of unbroken forest. Instead, it occupies mountaintops from the Adirondack Mountains of New York to Maine\u0026rsquo;s Mount Katahdin and the cold, poorly drained valley bottoms in between. It is at its most extensive in the high, rolling hill country of western Maine and northern New Hampshire, encouraged by the favorable climate, poor soils, and intensive logging practices that characterize the area.\nDespite its importance to people - from the Abenaki who ranged across this region to the rural communities that have formed within what is one of the most extensive blocks of commercial forestland in eastern North America- and as a redoubt for wild nature, the natural history of thus forests and its wild inhabitants remains poorly known. This represents an opportunity for advancing the science of ecology but at the same time poses a great challenge to our ability to use it wisely and sustainably.\nIn this project, I explore the natural history of the inland spruce-fir forests of the northeastern United States, shed light on the lives of its animals and plants, and seek to find solutions for its sustainable use by present-day human communities.\n","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"06a2ebfc818b5d0e0d7d49356b2707fa","permalink":"https://johnlloyd.name/project/sprucefirnaturalhistory/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/sprucefirnaturalhistory/","section":"project","summary":"Spruce-fir forests blanket the mountaintops and cold valley bottoms of the northeastern United States. In them live a distinctive mix of plants and animals drawn from environments both north and south, forming a broad link between the great deciduous forests of the eastern United States and massive boreal forests of Canada and Alaska. This project explores the natural history of these forests, with a focus on its wildlife, and the ways in which human use, past and present, influence the nature of this wild landscape. In doing so, I look to answer a straightforward yet difficult question: how, in the face of climate change, growing human populations, and globalized commodity markets, can we sustain the many values provided by these forests, both for people and for wild nature?","tags":["Conservation","biodiversity","Spruce-fir forests","Maine","New Hampshire"],"title":"Natural history of the spruce-fir forests of the northeastern United States","type":"project"},{"authors":["JJ Tewksbury","JD Lloyd"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":988689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":988689600,"objectID":"21e972dfac043eb5dd06ab93af96e6a7","permalink":"https://johnlloyd.name/publication/positiveinteractions/","publishdate":"2001-05-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/positiveinteractions/","section":"publication","summary":"Positive interactions often play an important role in structuring plant communities and increasing biological diversity. Using three scales of resolution, we examine the importance of a long-lived desert tree, ironwood (*Olneya tesota*), in structuring plant communities and promoting biological diversity in the Sonoran Desert. We examined the positive effects of *Olneya* canopies of different sizes on plant communities in mesic and xeric habitats throughout the central Gulf Coast subregion of Sonora, Mexico. In xeric sites, *Olneya* canopies had strong positive effects on plant richness and abundance, and small positive effects on the size of plants, underscoring the role of facilitation in extreme environments. In mesic sites, *Olneya* canopies had very little effect on perennials and a negative effect on ephemeral richness, suggesting predominantly competitive effects in this less stressful environment. Overall, *Olneya* canopies increased biological diversity where abiotic stress was high, but did not increase diversity in more mesic areas. Thus *Olneya* canopies caused consistent shifts in plant-community structure among xeric and mesic sites, but not when these landscapes were combined. Benefactor size also mediated positive interactions, with larger *Olneya* canopies supporting larger perennials in both xeric and mesic sites. Thus stress gradients and benefactor size both influenced the balance of facilitative and competitive effects under nurse-plant canopies, and the spatial scale at which facilitative effects shape community structure.","tags":["Facilitation","Community ecology","Desert ecology"],"title":"Positive interactions under nurse-plants: spatial scale, stress gradients and benefactor size","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  hurricaneEffectsOnBirds      h1 {font-size: 34px;} h1.title {font-size: 38px;} h2 {font-size: 30px;} h3 {font-size: 24px;} h4 {font-size: 18px;} h5 {font-size: 16px;} h6 {font-size: 12px;} code {color: inherit; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);} pre:not([class]) { background-color: white }   code{white-space: pre-wrap;} span.smallcaps{font-variant: small-caps;} span.underline{text-decoration: underline;} div.column{display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; width: 50%;} div.hanging-indent{margin-left: 1.5em; text-indent: -1.5em;} ul.task-list{list-style: none;}  code{white-space: pre;} if (window.hljs) { hljs.configure({languages: []}); hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); if (document.readyState \u0026\u0026 document.readyState === \"complete\") { window.setTimeout(function() { hljs.initHighlighting(); }, 0); } }  .main-container { max-width: 940px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } img { max-width:100%; } .tabbed-pane { padding-top: 12px; } .html-widget { margin-bottom: 20px; } button.code-folding-btn:focus { outline: none; } summary { display: list-item; } pre code { padding: 0; }  .tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs { display: inline-table; max-height: 500px; min-height: 44px; overflow-y: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px; } .tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs  li.active:before { content: \"\"; font-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings'; display: inline-block; padding: 10px; border-right: 1px solid #ddd; } .tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs.nav-tabs-open  li.active:before { content: \"\"; border: none; } .tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs.nav-tabs-open:before { content: \"\"; font-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings'; display: inline-block; padding: 10px; border-right: 1px solid #ddd; } .tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs  li.active { display: block; } .tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs  li  a, .tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs  li  a:focus, .tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs  li  a:hover { border: none; display: inline-block; border-radius: 4px; background-color: transparent; } .tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs.nav-tabs-open  li { display: block; float: none; } .tabset-dropdown  .nav-tabs  li { display: none; }     +++ title = “Short-term effects of hurricanes Maria and Irma on forest birds of Puerto Rico” date = 2001-05-01T00:00:00 draft = false\nAuthors.

Using dynamic community models analyzed within a Bayesian framework, we found significant changes in detectability, with some species becoming more readily detected after the storms and others becoming more difficult to detect during surveys. Changes in occupancy were equally mixed. Five species – mostly granivores and omnivores, but also Black-whiskered Vireo (Vireo altiloquus), a migratory insectivore - occupied more sites in 2018 than in 2015. Twelve species were less common after the hurricanes, including all of the obligate frugivores. Declines in site-occupancy rates were not only more common than increases, but tended to be of greater magnitude. Our results support the general conclusions that bird species respond largely independently to changes in forest structure caused by hurricanes, but that some dietary guilds, notably frugivores, are more sensitive and more likely to show changes in abundance or occupancy following strong storms”.\nabstract_short = “Hurricanes Irma and Maria were among the most damaging storms ever to sweep across Puerto Rico. The toll on the island’s people was enormous. We wondered how wildlife, especially birds, fared. By revisting, after the storms had passed, locations that we had surveyed for birds in 2015, we found that some species weathered these storms well - perhaps not surprising given the frequency with which tropical storms pass over the islands of the Caribbean - but others, especially, frugivores, declined following the storms. Hurricanes are neither categorically good nor categorically bad for wildlife.”\n Featured image thumbnail (optional) image_preview = “hurricanesAndBirds.png”\n Is this a selected publication?
