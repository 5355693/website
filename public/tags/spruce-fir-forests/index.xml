      <description>Between the great deciduous forests of the eastern United States and the broad sweep of Canada&amp;rsquo;s evergreens lies a zone of ecological tension. Think of it as the dry land version of the intertidal zone: washed over by temperate waves of life from the south but deeply influenced by the boreal forests to its north. Neither life zone dominates, but instead both contribute elements, and the result is unique. Perhaps due to the chimeric nature of this life zone, or perhaps because it is overshadowed by its parents - two of the great biomes of the planet - we don&amp;rsquo;t have a good name for it.</description>
