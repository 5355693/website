      <description>In June 2016, we assembled a group of scientists, practitioners, and policy-makers who are involved professionally with biodiversity conservation and charged them with the task of co-creating a research agenda for biodiversity conservation in Vermont. Participants were asked to answer two questions in particular: 1) what are the key threats to biodiversity in Vermont, and 2) what knowledge do we need to address these threats?
By bringing together this diverse group of stakeholders and asking them to discuss these questions together, we sought to narrow the divides among science, policy, and action that have at times hindered development and implementation of effective biodiversity-conservation strategies.</description>

      <title>Natural history of the spruce-fir forests of the northeastern United States</title>

      <description>Between the great deciduous forests of the eastern United States and the broad sweep of Canada&amp;rsquo;s evergreens lies a zone of ecological tension. Think of it as the dry land version of the intertidal zone: washed over by temperate waves of life from the south but deeply influenced by the boreal forests to its north. Neither life zone dominates, but instead both contribute elements, and the result is unique. Perhaps due to the chimeric nature of this life zone, or perhaps because it is overshadowed by its parents - two of the great biomes of the planet - we don&amp;rsquo;t have a good name for it.</description>
